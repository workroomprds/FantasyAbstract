# How to be an awesome tester

Everywhere I look we testers are encouraged to find ways to be better at what we do. We read articles and blogs that extol us to do improve our testing skillset, our communication and our craft in general. We listen to talks that explain why testing is dead (read unwanted) and how implicity its due to something we have done, or not done. If we just got more technical or better at bug finding, by demonstrating value, we can somehow stem the tide of jobs disapearing.  

As testers we're highly trained to identify faults. It's our job! We pull apart seemingly working software, analyse and sometimes almost magically find problems. But don't stop at software though. Often we look further afield and start analysing teams, delivery pipelines and even thee industry as a whole, picking apart and identifying potential problems in everthing we see.  

Many of us, turn this sharpened scalpel upon ourselves, scratching for ways to improve ourselves. But can we let this go too far? With our predeliction and our mindset that is trained to look for failure, can this wonderful skillset do us damage? 

In this workshop, we will look at what it takes to be an aweseome tester. We will look at some ideas that may help us identify what this means for us. We will explore when being a tester is a good force, but how to look for signs when perhaps we have taken our analysis too far. We will look at ways in which to harness our wonderful skills so we can truly be awesome testers.
