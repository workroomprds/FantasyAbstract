# A Thousand Tiny Servers

There’s a new way to control of your environments, and it’ll revolutionise your testing work.

Setting up a test environment is a core task for any test effort – but is troubled by long, error-prone and unrepeatable server setup.

It has recently become easy to set up environments swiftly, reliably and repeatably. The enabling tools are open-source, and have strong communities (outside testing).

In this workshop, we’ll guide you through small steps to build connected, multi-server test environments. You’ll use easy-access tools that allow you to drop, change, reconfigure and rebuild those environments. We’ll show you how to get access to those environments, how to monitor them and how to extract and use logs. You’ll take away template scripts for all the environments we build.

In half a day, with no prior experience, you'll discover that you can spin up a multinational, resilient banking system.
